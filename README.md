# e-commerce web application
## HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MySQL, and PHP, were the tools that allowed the project to take life.

We developed a website for online commerce, enabling users to browse and purchase goods while administrators managed products. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap were employed to craft a user-friendly design. A MySQL, PHP database was utilized to store client information, product details, and purchase history. The website was hosted on the 000webhost server, and GitHub served as our code repository. To oversee the project, MS Project was utilized, and Gantt charts were created to monitor our progress.
